# AR Gaussian Splatting for iOS & Metal 

<img src="media/Guassian Splat 2.PNG" height="200">

## About 
A buggy + slow AR gaussian splat renderer for iOS + Metal. 
Based on several existing projects:
- [Original Gaussian Splatting Repo](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/)
- [Unity Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting)
- [WebGL Gaussian Splats](https://github.com/antimatter15/splat)
- [WebGPU Gaussian Splatting from cvlab-epfl](https://github.com/cvlab-epfl/gaussian-splatting-web) 
- [MrNeRF gaussian splatting cuda](https://github.com/MrNeRF/gaussian-splatting-cuda)


Uses [Satin + Forge](https://github.com/Hi-Rez/Satin) for AR + 3d viewer ( by [@rezaali](https://twitter.com/RezaAli) )


Only tested on an iPhone 14 Pro. Older phones will probably struggle. You can adjust the render resolution when loading a model by increasing the rendererDownsample to 4x or more on the 'SplatModelInfo' struct. 


:warning: This was a quick weekend hack project for educational purposes. As such the code is bad.  

ðŸ”¹ NOTE: PLY models use [git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) for file storage. You may need to run ```git lfs pull``` if PLYs are missing


## Notes 
- Does not use a tile based renderer, just basic quad rasterization
- Spherical harmonics are not supported
- Sorting is done on main thread with std::sort on CPU 
### Todos
- fix pan / drag / rotate gesture handling for moving the model - now it's broken
- snap models to AR planes
- GPU sorting 
- detect centroids and model extents on load rather than hand specifying

## Train your own model 
There are several [blog posts](https://www.reshot.ai/3d-gaussian-splatting) on how to train your own models from a set of images. 
The output PLY model is what you want to keep ( e.g. 'iteration_30000/point_cloud.ply' ) 
The included models were trained on google colab with an A100 GPU.
